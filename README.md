# Home Credit Indonesia - Credit Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is part of a Data Scientist Virtual Internship program offered through **Rakamin Academy** in collaboration with **Home Credit Indonesia**, a leading consumer finance company in Indonesia. The project aims to predict credit risk for loan applicants using a combination of core and supplementary datasets.

We worked with:
- 300K+ core loan applications
- 53M+ records from 7 supporting datasets including bureau, credit card, POS_CASH, previous applications, and installments.

Models built include **Random Forest**, **LightGBM**, and **Logistic Regression**, with attention to class imbalance. Feature engineering was performed across multiple datasets to maximize predictive power.

**Best Model Performance (Random Forest):**
- Recall: 90%
- Precision: 63%
- ROC-AUC: 0.98

These results allow actionable insights for accurate loan approval and effective risk mitigation.
